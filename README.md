<h4 align="center">A tool for the complete and total visualization of your React application</h4>

[Reactron](https://reactron.io/) bolsters development by rendering three essentials parts of any project: the latest version of your application including functionality, a React Component Tree for a macroscopic view of your project, and single component rendering for a microscopic understanding.

As of March 2022, Reactron is no longer an active project and cannot be accessed from reactron.io. Please feel free to continue to fork and use on your own.

<!-- ## Features in the pipeline

<br>

1. **Works with any React application** - ReactION supports React 16.1+ (including React Fiber) and React Router v4.
2. **Visualize your app** - ReactION shows the current structure of your application in real time with hot reloading.
3. **Preview your HTML** - Live render of your App through the in-editor HTML preview in sync with the tree view.
4. **From Tree to Codes** - ReactION will open up the React file that is associated with the particular component on the tree view when you click it.
5. **Gain quick insights into your React tree state** - the React tree nodes will have different colors based on its current state and props, including the latest component change.
6. **Debug your React** - With ReactION, you can travel through different state changes of your React application -->
